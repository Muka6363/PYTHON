        "\n",
        "Purpose of the this coding challenge is to write a program that creates a phonebook and performs certain operations on the phonebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Learning Outcomes\n",
        "\n",
        "At the end of the this coding challenge, students will be able to;\n",
        "\n",
        "- analyze a problem, identify and apply programming knowledge for appropriate solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- design, implement `for` and `while` loops effectively in Python to solve the given problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "- control loops effectively by using `if` and `control` statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "- demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by using function effectively.\n",
