Then he has the second student go to every second locker and close it. The third goes to every third locker and, if it is closed, he opens it, and if it is open, he closes it. The fourth student does this to every fourth locker, and so on. After the process is completed with the \"n\"th student, how many lockers are open?\n",

So input of the function is just one number which shows number of lockers and number of students. For example if there are 1000 lockers and 1000 students in school then input is 1000 and function returns number of open lockers after 1000th student completes his action.\n",
